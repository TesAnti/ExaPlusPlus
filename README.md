# Exa++
High level programming language for EXAPUNKS

![Demo image](images/demo_image.png)

Tired of tracking all that low-level code? Or, maybe just want to look at the same game from a different perspective?
Then you need to try **Exa++**.

The goals of the project:
- make a programming language that is easy to use
- beat all levels ot the game with it

# Features
- EXA definition syntax
- loops(forever, foreach, while, until)
- if-else conditions
- math expressions

Also you will get 30-50% more compact code and ease of readability.

Unfortunately, due to EXAPUNKS specifics, you have only one variable **'x'**(T, F and M are used internally). As i see so far, it's not a problem.
